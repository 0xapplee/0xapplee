# Hello, I'm 0xApple 👋

Independent Smart Contract Security Researcher specializing in Solidity auditing and DeFi protocol security. I focus on manual code reviews, invariant testing, and identifying high-impact vulnerabilities in real-world smart contract systems. My audit experience spans governance and voting contracts, ERC4626 vaults and yield strategies, cross-chain bridges, staking and rewards distribution mechanisms, AMM and liquidity infrastructure, intent-based execution systems, stablecoin accounting logic, and derivatives protocols. 

🛠 Tools: Foundry, Hardhat, Slither, Echidna
